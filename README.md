# Multiplayer Project (Work in Progress)

This is my own project to learn how to use Unity's Lobby and Relay services and combine them with Netcode to create a multiplayer experience.  
My main focus will be on the code and not the gameplay.  
As the tile says this is a work in progress.  

Visit my [Trello Page](https://trello.com/b/w26djOpW/unity-fps-multiplayer) to see what I'm up to now.
